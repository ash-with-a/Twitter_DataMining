Twitter Data Mining using Python

This project is intended to give insightful outcomes.


First step -  Creating a Twitter Application
Use a Twitter Developer Account to extract Tweets from the Twitter platform. Create, if you doesn't have one. Create an Application in the Twitter Developer Account. Generate the Keys and Tokens, and note them down. Here, the Keys are very important to have as we use them to gather the Tweets.


Second step - Aunthentication
Now, import 'Tweepy', which is the Python library to access the Twitter API. Next, add the Keys to authorize the access to Twitter data.


Third step - Creating API object
Do not delete this since it is the base for every following application to be built.


Fourth step - Pulling Tweets from Timeline
Here, 10 most recent Tweets from your Twitter feed are pulled using the API object. The result will be a bunch of random Tweets, and the URL to each Tweet. You can view the Tweet by clicking on the URL.


Fifth step - Finding Text, Date, Time, and Location 
In the print statements, use the snippets to know the user's text, date, time, and location about their Tweet.


Sixth step - Loading Tweets from a specific User
This will be helpful to collect a number of Tweets from a particular user or page to know the genre, in general.


Seventh step - Searching Tweets through a 'Keyword'
It is interesting to pull Tweets regarding a certain topic using the 'Keyword-Search'. We can also include the feature of oulling the Tweets in a desired language. I used 'English' language here. 




This process is very much helpful to extract Feedback on a newly launched product, or a service. It serves as an extremely useful tool in terms of Marketing. Mining the users' opinions provides a successful solution in troubleshooting the issues associated with a deployed product, and to improve the features of it. New versions can be planned and built as many users leave their suggestions and expectations in their Tweets.
